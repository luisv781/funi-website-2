				<h1>how to get portable apps (outdated)</h1>
				<img class="article-image small" src="/funi-website-2/assets/images/more/more_apps_1.png">
				<p>Go to my <a class="link-normal" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LvQfaXPWsqBmCbWQSlHQm2MdhwR8XaE2?usp=sharing">google drive link</a> and go to the apps folder</p>
				<p>If you google decides to give you a popup, make sure to choose download</p>
				<img class="article-image small" src="/funi-website-2/assets/images/more/more_apps_2.png">
				<p>After the file is done downloading, open it and just click next and install</p>
				<p>you dont really have to change anything unless you wanna put it in a different folder</p>
				<p>you can also move the folder after it's done installing</p>
				<img class="article-image small" src="/funi-website-2/assets/images/more/more_apps_3.png">
				<p>when it's done installing, just go inside the folder and you'll find the exe file there</p>
				<p>if you want to be able to find it faster, you can also right-click it and click on create shortcut</p>
				<br>
				<img class="article-image small" src="/funi-website-2/assets/images/more/more_apps_4.png">
				<p>Finally, if you want to download other portable apps or you want to get a more updated version, you can go to portableapps.com</p>
				<p>it's blocked so i recommend downloading them at home bc free vpns are slow af</p>

				<h1>how to play steam games (outdated)</h1>
				<p>you can download some games for free but not all of them work bc of lag or missing software (for example terraria).</p>
				<p>steamunlocked is not a good way to download free games because of malware and fake download links</p>
				<p>Personally I use and recommend gog-games.to or steamrip.com</p>
				<p>u probably shouldnt try to download games directly from the laptop unless you're using a hotspot and a vpn</p>
				<p>try to download something from your phone or a different computer, and use bluetooth or preferably a usb if you have one (faster)</p><br>
				<p>If you really have to download from the laptop, download a different browser like firefox in my google drive.</p>
				<p>Then download the ublock extension to block ads, connect to a hotspot, and get a free vpn like SetupVPN or Windscribe</p>
				<p>Make sure you dont log in anywhere while you have a vpn on, because theres a reason why these sketchy ass vpns are free</p>

				<h1>how to play emulated games</h1>
				<p><b>Update:</b> RetroArch can't be installed on a chromebook, but the website should work fine. You still have to download roms tho.</p>
				<p>RetroArch is a program that lets you emulate games from the gba, ds, and a lot of other retro consoles.</p>
				<img class="article-image medium" src="/funi-website-2/assets/images/more/emulate_games_1.png">
				<p>You can download RetroArch at <a class="link-normal" href="https://retroarch.com">https://retroarch.com</a> and you can also play online but it's slower.</p>
				<p>when you download it, make sure you are clicking download and not installer</p>
				<p>installers are blocked, so make sure you are clicking the right link</p>
				<p>After it's done downloading, you will have a .7z file that you might not be able to open</p>
				<img class="article-image small" src="/funi-website-2/assets/images/more/emulate_games_2.png">
				<p>To open it, you will have to download 7-ZipPortable.exe from the apps folder in my <a class="link-normal" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LvQfaXPWsqBmCbWQSlHQm2MdhwR8XaE2?usp=sharing">google drive</a></p>
				<p>Open 7-Zip after you're done installing it, and use it to open the .7z file you downloaded from the RetroArch website.</p>
				<img class="article-image medium" src="/funi-website-2/assets/images/more/emulate_games_3.png">
				<p>Extract/copy the files out of it and put them somewhere like a folder in your downloads folder.</p>
				<p>Then you can go to the folder you extracted and you should be able to find a file called "retroarch.exe" in the middle of all those files</p>
				<img class="article-image small" src="/funi-website-2/assets/images/more/emulate_games_4.png">
				<p>Don't open it yet because you won't have any games installed yet</p>
				<br>
				<h2>where to download roms for RetroArch</h2>
				<p>I recommend <a class="link-normal" href="https://r-roms.github.io">this website</a> for downloading roms</p>
				<p>It's blocked unfortunately, but if you have a portable browser and use a different wifi it should work.</p>
				<p>I'll also be uploading requested roms in google drive</p>
				<br>
				<p>After you're done downloading roms, you need to add cores to RetroArch</p>
				<p>cores are like separate console emulators that you'll need to install before you can use a rom</p>
				<p>Open retroarch.exe and go to Online Updater. You'll need to be connected to your own wifi or you will get an error.</p>
				<img class="article-image medium" src="/funi-website-2/assets/images/more/emulate_games_5.png">
				<p>Click on Core Downloader and a list of consoles should show up</p>
				<p>Download the consoles that you want to emulate and after you're done, press x to go back.</p>
				<p>You can now go to Load Content to open the roms that you downloaded</p>
				<p>Press z to choose a folder and x to go back. Your downloads folder is in the D:\ drive.</p>
				<p>To exit a game, press f1 to open the quick menu. From there you can also save and load state</p>
				<p>you should also favorite the game, so you can find it more quickly.</p>
